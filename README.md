# jianpu-test
Testing a transfer to GitHub Organisation

See https://github.com/ssb22/jianpu-ly/issues/26

* [ ] can we still `git clone https://github.com/ssb22/jianpu-test.git`
* [ ] can we still `git clone git@github.com:ssb22/jianpu-test.git`
* [ ] can it still appear in [my repositories tab](https://github.com/ssb22?tab=repositories), in case anyone looks for it (or looks for "stuff I've done recently") in that tab?  or does this not matter?
* [ ] can I still arrange for jianpu-ly to appear on [my "popular repositories" list](https://github.com/ssb22) (hard to test that with a second repository!)  or does this not matter?
* [ ] will [git2gmi](https://github.com/ssb22/bits-and-bobs/blob/master/git2gmi.py) still catch any commits I make when it's in an organisation?  (If not, can it be fixed up to do so?)
